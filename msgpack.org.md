# RcppMsgPack
Convert to and from msgpack objects in R using the official msgpack-c API through Rcpp.

*A flowchart describing the conversion of R objects into msgpack objects and back.*

Msgpack EXT types are converted to raw vectors with EXT attributes containing the extension type.  The extension type must be an integer from 0 to 127.  

Maps are converted to data.frames with additional class "map".  Map objects in R contain key and value list columns and can be simplified to named lists or named vectors.  The helper function `msgpack_map` creates map objects that can be serialized into msgpack.  

For more information on msgpack types, see [here](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md).
