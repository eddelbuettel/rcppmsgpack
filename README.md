MsgPack Headers for R

### About

This package provides [R](http://www.r-project.org) with
[MessagePack](http://msgpack.org/) header files.  [MessagePack](http://msgpack.org/) is an
efficient binary serialization format.  It lets you exchange data among multiple languages
like JSON. But it is faster and smaller. Small integers are encoded into a single byte,
and typical short strings require only one extra byte in addition to the strings
themselves.

[MessagePack](http://msgpack.org/) is used by [Redis](http://redis.io) and many other projects.

To use this package, simply add it to the `LinkingTo:` field in the `DESCRIPTION` field of
your R package---and the R package infrastructure tools will then know how to set include
flags correctly on all architectures supported by R.

header-only) libraries from [Boost](http://www.boost.org/), and the

Redis support.
