Description: 'MessagePack' is an efficient binary serialization format.
 It lets you exchange data among multiple languages like 'JSON'. But it is
 faster and smaller. Small integers are encoded into a single byte, and
 typical short strings require only one extra byte in addition to the strings
 themselves. This package provides headers from the 'msgpack-c'
 implementation for C and C++(11) for use by R, particularly 'Rcpp'. The
 included 'msgpack-c' headers are licensed under the Boost Software License
 (Version 1.0); the code added by this package as well the R integration are
 licensed under the GPL (>= 2). See the files 'COPYRIGHTS' and 'AUTHORS' for
 a full list of  copyright holders and contributors to 'msgpack-c'.
