Version: 0.1.0

Description: 'MessagePack' is an efficient binary serialization format.
 It lets you exchange data among multiple languages like 'JSON'. But it is
 faster and smaller. Small integers are encoded into a single byte, and
 typical short strings require only one extra byte in addition to the strings
 themselves.
 .    
 This package provides headers from the 'msgpack-c' implementation for C
 and C++(11) for use by R, particularly 'Rcpp'. The included 'msgpack-c'
 header are licensed under the Boost Software License (Version 1.0); the
 code added by this package as well the R integration are licensed under 
 the GPL (>= 2).
 .
 The package currently includes the 'MessagePack' headers. We may alter it 
 to depend on external 'MessagePack' headers once Debian get release 1.4.0
 or later in its main distribution (as opposed to the experimental one).
