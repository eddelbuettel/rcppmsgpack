Description: 'MessagePack' is an efficient binary serialization format.
 It lets you exchange data among multiple languages like 'JSON'. But it is
 faster and smaller. Small integers are encoded into a single byte, and
 typical short strings require only one extra byte in addition to the strings
 themselves.
 .    
 This package provides headers from the 'msgpack-c' implementation for C
